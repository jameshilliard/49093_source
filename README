packserv.py -   tRPC (tHA) packet server application.

    The packet server connects to a serial (COM) port and parses the data stream for valid
    tekmar packets (tpcks).  The packet server then forwards all valid packets it has received
    from the serial port to all socket connections.  The packet server also listens for valid
    tpcks from the socket connections and then writes the tpcks that it has received to the
    serial port.

    Example command line usage:
        python packserv.py /dev/com7 localhost 55444

    The packet server above is connected to COM port 7 and listening on localhost, port 55444
    for socket connections.

trpc_msg.py -   tRPC (tHA) message formatting module.

    This module is an implmentation of the trpc/tHA protocol

    Example usage:
        see trpc_sock.py example below.

trpc_sock.py -   tRPC (tHA) packet/socket abstraction module.

    This module is used for connecting to the packet server described above and it uses the
    settings (host address and port) configured in get_trpc_host.py module.

    Example usage:
        import trpc_sock
        import trpc_msg

        sock = trpc_sock.TrpcSocket()
        sock.open()
        p = trpc_msg.TrpcPacket(service = 'Request', method = 'HeatSetpoint', address = 1001)
        sock.write(p)
        sock.close()

        p = sock.read()
        if p != None:
            service_id = p.header["serviceID"]
            method_id = p.header["methodID"]
            address = p.body["address"]

get_trpc_host.py -   Configure the host address and port for the packet server.

    THis module is used to configure the host address and port parameters used by the
    trpc_sock.py module.  It also allows for environment variables TRPC_HOST and TRPC_PORT to
    be used for configuration.  

trpc_receive.py -   tRPC (tHA) packet/socket viewer.

    This module connects to a packet server and displays all valid trpc packets that it
    receives.  In other words this prints out all trpc packets received from the serial port
    connected to the packet server.

tpck.py -   tpck protocol implementation module.
packet.py -   Packet formatting module.
fields.py -   Packed binary field handling module.

tha_demo.py -   A stand-alone implementation of the tHA stack.

    This file can be broken down in to two section, the first contains an implementation
    of the tHA stack, although all of the accesors for the tHA parameters are not implemented.
    The second is another implementation of the trpc_receive.py, except that it is a direct
    connection to the serial port instead of through the packet server.
